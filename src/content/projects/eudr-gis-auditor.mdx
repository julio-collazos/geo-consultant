## Project Overview

The Land Use Change Viewer is an interactive web application designed to help environmental analysts and project managers explore multi-period land use classification data across a large geographic area. The tool integrates satellite-derived land cover maps from five time periods (2005–2020) with a spatial database of palm oil concession boundaries.

## Context & Problem

Large-scale environmental monitoring projects often produce classification maps that are technically rigorous but effectively inaccessible to non-GIS specialists. Project managers needed to be able to answer questions like:

- Which concessions had the highest deforestation rates between 2010 and 2015?
- What proportion of each concession is covered by secondary vegetation today?
- How has land use changed inside vs. outside protected areas over time?

These questions require querying 3.5 million polygons across hundreds of spatial units — a task that is impossible in a standard GIS desktop without significant technical skill.

## Methodology

1. **Data preparation** — Satellite imagery classified using a Random Forest algorithm (scikit-learn) per time period, validated against ~1,200 reference polygons
2. **Data model** — Land use class transitions stored in a PostGIS database with spatial indexing for fast queries
3. **API layer** — FastAPI backend exposing time-filtered aggregation queries per spatial unit
4. **Front end** — React-based viewer with Leaflet map, period selector, and analytics panel showing pie charts and transition matrices

  This tool cut our reporting time in half. I can now get answers that used to require a dedicated
  GIS analyst and two days of processing.
