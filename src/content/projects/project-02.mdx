## Project Overview

The Environmental Monitoring Pipeline is an automated system for ingesting, processing, and serving Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and in-situ sensor data for a conservation monitoring program. The pipeline runs weekly and provides near-real-time vegetation and water dynamics for a 400,000 ha area.

## Context & Problem

Conservation monitoring organizations typically analyze satellite data manually and periodically — a workflow that is slow, labor-intensive, and produces inconsistent results across analysts. The goal was to design a system that would:

- Automate image acquisition and preprocessing without manual intervention
- Store results in a queryable spatial database
- Surface alerts when vegetation health indicators drop below critical thresholds
- Work within the infrastructure constraints of a small technical team (no dedicated data engineering team)

## Methodology

The pipeline follows a four-stage architecture:

1. **Ingestion** — Google Earth Engine Python API scheduled via GitHub Actions, pulling weekly Sentinel-2 composites (cloud-masked, median-reduced)
2. **Processing** — Spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, EVI) computed per monitoring zone and stored as both raster summaries and polygon statistics in PostGIS
3. **Alert system** — PostgreSQL triggers flag zones where NDVI drops >15% below the 5-year baseline for the same seasonal window
4. **API** — Lightweight FastAPI service provides data to the visualization dashboard

The entire pipeline runs on Docker Compose and can be deployed on a single virtual machine, keeping infrastructure costs minimal while handling weekly processing for the full area of interest.
